# Stock-analysis.

## Overview.
The purpose of this project is to refactor the code of Module 2 that collect information about stock market during years of 2017 â€“ 2018; and determinate if this process will make the VBA script run faster.

## Background.
The module 2 code calculates the total daily volume and yearly return for stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. 
The results are showed in a table, it is formatting to determine stock performance immediately. We are looking to loop through all the data one time to collect the same information but efficiently.

## Results.
After imported VBA_Challenge.vbs to script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor, I reused the code of set variables the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activation of the worksheet. Then , I follow the steps to create a tickerIndex , set arrays, create a loop to thought all data and the conditionals for the starting and ending prices.

As a result in 2017 stock market had a better performance. 92% of stocks give a positive return compare with 17% of 2018.  Total daily volume in 2018 exceed  4% the previous year. However, only 2 stocks give return that represent 33% of stocks traded.

Regarding the execution time, the refactoring code runs in less time than the original.

## Summary.

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code.

Refactoring makes a clean code,  easy to understand, extend and maintain in the future by eliminate unnecessary complexity or features, in this process is possible to finding some bugs that help improve the code quality. However , there is a risk to  edit a code when the application is big and the developers do not understand what's all about and it this process become expensive and time  consuming.
